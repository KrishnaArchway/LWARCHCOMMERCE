					will not be a What's Change Report needed. It is not needed because
					there will be such a dramatic change from the old planogram to the
					new planogram and there would be no need to line list every change

					properly plan for if they should execute the reset (we ask that you
					work with your MPSM prior to making this decision) how they will
					spread their retail items within that bay for those holes. The
